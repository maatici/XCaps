# XCaps
A Model combines Xception and Dynamic Routing Layer of CapsNet

This model is designed to combine advanteges of XCeption and Capsule networks for brain tumor classification on publicly available MRI dataset shared in : https://figshare.com/articles/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427

In the original Xception architecture, after the global average pool, the dynamic routing layer of the capsule architecture is used in the proposed architecture instead of 2048-sized vectors and fully connected layer.
